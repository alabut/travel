            <h1>Overview</h1>
  
            <p>Portland, "The City of Roses", is the largest city in Oregon and the third largest city in the Pacific Northwest after Seattle and Vancouver, British Columbia. It lies about 70 mi (124 km) from the Pacific Coast on the northern border of the state of Oregon, straddling the Willamette (pronounced will-AM-et) River 12 mi (19 km) south of its confluence with the Columbia River. Vancouver, Washington (not to be confused with Vancouver, Canada) is a Portland suburb and lies immediately on the other side of the Columbia River. </p>

            <h2>The City</h2>
            <p>Portland is the largest city lying between San Francisco and Seattle and when compared to those cities, Portland's environment is not as fast-paced; instead it has a more laid-back, smaller town feel to it. Portland, however, is still a city just shy of 600,000 people, and as such has its fair share of amenities, including an impressive music and arts scene and one of the largest collections of zine and independent publishers of any city in the nation. The city hasn't yet developed to the point of being overwhelming. However, in recent years Portland's growth has started to catch up with daily living, such as having some of the worst traffic congestion in the West, a high cost of living relative to wages, and chronic underemployment.
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>The city hasn't yet developed to the point of being overwhelming.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>The city has a lovely blend of historic and modern architecture and many lush parks to poke your toes into; Forest Park and Washington Park in the hills west of Downtown offer a variety of plants, trails, and wildlife near the city. Vistas of Mt. Hood and the Willamette River, stately Douglas Fir trees, and roses and trees at every turn give the city stunning seasonal color. Environmentally friendly practices, such as recycling and an extensive (though not as well-serviced as it was in the recent past) public transportation system, are part of the culture here and fuel many progressive city planning practices, such as an urban growth boundary, which have made Portland a relatively compact city. Unlike most similar-sized metropolitan areas in the country, you can drive 15 mi (24 km) from downtown and be out in the countryside.

            <h3>Climate</h3>
            <p>As in other places in the Pacific Northwest, there is abundant rainfall in the fall, winter, and spring. The rain is often a menacing drizzle or mist, meaning you'll often be wet; total precipitation in Seattle and Portland is technically less than many east coast and southeastern cities because there are fewer downpours, instead the rain opts for a near constant drizzle. A sunny day in the rainy season can seem to be very rare, and Portlanders have the unusual habit of wearing shorts and flip-flops the minute the sun comes out, even if the temperature is barely above freezing. Portland has very little snow, instead the winters are very rainy. Bring or buy an umbrella if you're in Portland between October and June. However, it is no myth that a large portion of "Portlanders" don't use, or even believe in, umbrellas, instead preferring hoods and raincoats. 
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Bring or buy an umbrella if you're in Portland between October and June.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>It's worth mentioning that there are really only two seasons in the Portland area - rain and summer. The rain and clouds typically last 9 months, from late September often until late June, then suddenly the clouds clear and it is hot and sunny. There is not really a gradual increase in temperatures, it's basically either 48°F (9°C) degrees and raining, or 85°F (29°C) and sunny. Prospective visitors who don't care for rain should be aware that Portland summers, although short, are quite pleasant - July through September have only a 10% chance of rain on any given day, temperatures rarely exceed 85°F (29°C) degrees or so, and local produce (including fresh sweet cherries and some of the world's best berries) is available at farmers' markets and fruit stands in and around the city. July and August are typically the hottest months, temperatures occasionally hit 100°F (38°C) or more.

            <h3>On foot</h3>
            <p>Portland is a great city for walking. Many intersections are designed with pedestrians in mind, and Portland has a lot of street life. Good mass transit also makes walking more feasible in Portland. The City of Portland Office of Transportation offers free, highly detailed walking maps [25] that may be ordered online. For a scenic walk, the Eastside Esplanade [26] along the Willamette River across from downtown offers lovely views of the skyline. Parts of the esplanade actually float on the water.
            </p>
            <h3>By bike</h3>
            <p>Portland is an excellent city for cycling, with a network of streets designed to be predominantly used by bicyclists. These streets, such as SE Ankeny, SE Salmon, SE Lincoln, and SE Clinton, are usually spaced about halfway between the main car thoroughfares in the grid of East Portland. The bike streets are generally signed with green "Bike Route" signs. Additionally, many major streets have striped bike lanes. Maps of bike trails can be obtained from Metro [27], in the Bike There! section. Bikes can also be taken on all buses and MAX lines. The City of Portland Office of Transportation has a bicycle rental webpage [28].
